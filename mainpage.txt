oILAB is an open source C++ library to explore the crystallography of lattices and bicrystallography of interfaces. Some of its key features are
    -# Dimension-independent algorithms implemented using C++ templates
    -# Bicrystallography is explored using the Smith normal form for integer matrices
    -# Generates bicrystals with coincident relation, and calculates the coincident site- and displacement shift complete-lattices
    -# Generates arbitrary rational grain and phase boundaries, and characterizes disconnections by calculating the Burgers vectors and step heights
